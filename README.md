Weighted Lasso Estimates for Sparse Logistic Regressions
Emphasis is on classification performance, because in many cases we are interested in high-dimensional systems, so l1-penalized logistic regression is becoming more popular. However, the Lasso estimates could be problematic when the penalty are not related to data. Several choices of weights for weighted Lasso estimates have been discussed and their weights are chosen by: our proposed two types of weights by concentration inequality, standard deviation for predictors and adaptive lasso weights. Given sample size n and dimension of variables p, the finite sample behavior of the proposed method with a diverging number of predictors is illustrated by non-asymptotic oracle inequalities such as l1-estimation error and square prediction error of the unknown parameters. We also compare the performance of the four kinds of weights on simulated data, then apply these methods to do real data analysis.
